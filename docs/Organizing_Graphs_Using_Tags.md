# Organizing Graphs Using Tags

GraphSpace uses tags as a mechanism for grouping a set of graphs, e.g., all the graphs that a user may desire to make public upon the publication of a paper. A graph may have any number of tags. GraphSpace includes an interface to search for networks that match one or more tags. Tags, which organize graphs, provide a system that is orthogonal to groups, which organize
collaborators.

**Note**: Tags provide a level of organization that are orthogonal to groups. Groups are intended to organize collaborating users of GraphSpace while tags are used to collect graphs.
