# Organizing Graphs Using Tags

To aid the organization of graphs, GraphSpace uses the concept of tags. Each graph may have any number of tags. A tag is a useful mechanism for grouping a set of graphs, e.g., all the graphs that a user may desire to make public upon the publication of a paper. All tags associated with a graph must be defined in the metadata for the graph. Hence, tags may be specified only when a user uploads graphs using the REST API. A user can search for graphs that match a tag. To search for multiple tags, simply separate them with commas. Currently, the user must know the exact name of the tag.

**Note**: Tags provide a level of organization that are orthogonal to groups. Groups are intended to organize collaborating users of GraphSpace while tags are used to collect graphs.
