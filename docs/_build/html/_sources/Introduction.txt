# Introduction

Networks have become ubiquitous in scientific enquiry. Visualization is a crucial component in their analyses. Many websites exist for visualizing networks, but they tend to be specific to the computational algorithm used. Standalone packages have limited features for sharing visualizations between collaborators. GraphSpace is an easy-to-use web-based platform that collaborating research groups can use for storing, interacting with, and sharing networks. 

GraphSpace is being developed by [T. M. Murali](http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali) 's research group in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech.
