# Editing Layouts

GraphSpace provides powerful tools for the selection, movement, and organization of multiple nodes in a graph. The user can activate this functionality by clicking the `Use Layout Editor` button. 

## Start Tour 

The `Start Tour` button walks the user through all the features provided in the tool pallette. The Exit layout editor button gives a user the option to save the current layout and/or go back to the original view of the current graph. In the layout editor, the user may wield the tool pallette on the right hand side to quickly re-arrange the structure of the graph. 

## Show node labels

Unchecking the `Show node labels` checkbox takes a user of GraphSpace to a simplified view of the graph that hides node names.

## Select by shape

The `Select by shape` section allows the user to choose nodes in the graph based on nodes `shape` style property. For example, if a user wishes to select all nodes that are rectangles or ellipses, he/she will select both "Ellipse" and "Rectangle" in the tool pallete.

## Select by color

The `Select by color` section allows the user to choose nodes in the graph based on nodes `background-color` style property. For example, if a user wishes to select all nodes that are yellow or green, he/she will select both yellow and green.
