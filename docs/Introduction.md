# Introduction

Networks have become ubiquitous in systems biology. [Visualization](/Viewing_Graphs.html) is a crucial component in
their analysis. However, collaborations within research teams in network biology are hampered by software
systems that are either specific to a computational algorithm, create visualizations that are not biologically
meaningful, or have limited features for sharing networks and visualizations. 

We present GraphSpace, a web-based platform that fosters team science by allowing collaborating research groups to easily store, interact with, lay out, and share networks. Users can upload [richly-annotated networks](/Viewing_Graphs.html#node-and-edge-popups), irrespective of the algorithms or software used to generate them. Users can create private [groups](Terminology.html#groups), invite other users to join groups, and [share networks](/Sharing_Graphs.html) with group members. A user may [search for networks](/Searching_Graphs.html) for specific attributes and for the presence of a specific node or nodes. A powerful [layout editor](/Editing_Layouts.html) allows users to efficiently modify node positions, [edit node](/Editing_Layouts.html#edit-selected-nodes) and [edge styles](/Editing_Layouts.html#edit-selected-edges), save new layouts, and [share them](/Sharing_Graphs.html#sharing-layouts-with-group-s) with other users. Users may make networks public and provide a persistent URL in a publication, enabling others to explore these networks. While users can view and interact with GraphSpace networks anonymously, several features become available after a user creates an account and logs in. We describe the [main features](/Quick_Tour_of_GraphSpace.html) of GraphSpace in this documentation.

GraphSpace is being developed by [T. M. Murali](http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali) 's research group in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech.
